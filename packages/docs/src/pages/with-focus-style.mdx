# withFocusStyle

Provide visual focus styles to other components by using the _withFocusStyle_ higher order component. This hoc does not create any unnecessary HTML elements.

All of the components passed as an argument to the hoc must have a `isFocused` prop interface.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Logo, LogoProps } from '../logo';
import { withFocusStyle } from './with-focus-style';

const FocusableLogo = withFocusStyle<LogoProps>(Logo)
<FocusableLogo title={logoTitle} desc={logoDesc} isFocused={false} />
```
